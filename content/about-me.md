# Hi, I'm Ekki!
![Ekki Face](/img/newface.jpg)  I like to make and play games, build software and follow various other interests. I currently work as a Game Developer at [Gentleforge](https://gentleforge.business.site), where I helped ship the first title "Fairyfail".
You can find more info on what I did professionally on the [Stuff I Built]({{< ref "/stuff-i-built" >}} "Stuff I Built") page.  
For CV info please refer to my [LinkedIn-Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-erik-b%C3%A4hr-aa73a5b9/).
