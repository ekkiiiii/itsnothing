## Hi, I'm Ekki

![Ekki Face](/img/newface_very_small.png)  

I like to make and play games, build software and a bunch of other things (see Twitter :)).  
I am currently looking for work as a game developer (design and or programming), preferably in an indie team.  
You can find more info on what I did professionally on the [Portfolio]({{< ref "/portfolio" >}} "Portfolio") page.  
For CV info please refer to my [LinkedIn-Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-erik-b%C3%A4hr-aa73a5b9/).
