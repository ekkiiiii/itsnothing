## How is this site made?
The page is built with Hugo, I have already written about it [here](/post/creating-websites-with-hugo).  
The theme is called [terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) and it is made by [panr](https://twitter.com/panr).  
You can retrace all the customizations I made and will make on the [blog's GitHub repository](https://github.com/ekkiiiii/itsnothing).

## What about those neat graphics?
The images are virtuosly made with Microsoft Paint, with the help of a graphics tablet or directly on a touchscreen, so you'll only find hand-made, artisanal blog graphics here.
