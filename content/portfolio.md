I like to build things! This page shows some of the things I helped to build. For a CV-like overview visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janerikbaehr/)-page.
  
What I like most is the practical aspect of building (virtual) things: writing code, creating prototypes, taking an idea into the real world and then seeing what works and - behold - what does not work as intended.
But since I always worked in small teams that require a large amount of self-organization I am used to spending just as much as time with the theoretical side of it: working on game design and technical architectures and figuring out how to make something that is fun to interact with.

## Games

#### Fairyfail
{{< youtube TKAHszC510Q >}}

From January 2021 to July 2022 I was working at [Gentleforge](https://gentleforge.com/) where I did programming and game design for [Fairyfail](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1194670/Fairyfail) until we shipped the game in July 2021 and for the 'Bewitched' Update in October 2021.

#### Shiba Rush

A personal side project I started together with [@VeFroh](https://mobile.twitter.com/artvefroh). We did the design together based on a cancelled project that we worked on together at Gentleforge before. Vero contributed the art and I did the coding. We have stopped working after this first prototype and changed the game concept a lot, but stuck with the Shiba theme and overall mood. [I have written a small post mortem about that prototype here](http://www.itsnothing.de/post/shiba-rush-post-mortem/). An update about the new project will follow in a few weeks.


## Jam Games

#### Deeper Learning (2021)

A collectible book game built for Ludum Dare in three days. We set out with a mission to keep the scope small... To end up with something way too complicated yet again - but it was really fun and definetely turned out interesting. No one from our team did have time to take part in the judging phase for this one :(.

#### Was War Es Einmal (2021)

This was done for Manasoup Game Jam, a gamejam from a german speaking community for game developers. It was only a two day gamejam and we had a pretty big team to manage. I like how small we kept the scope, and even added the repeat functionality a few weeeks after the jam.

#### Mildy Entertaining Games

Most of my earlier game jam games can be found on the [mildlyentertaining.games website](https://mildlyentertaining.games).

#### Doom, Death and Destruction Tycoon
We had some fun here creating a small simulation of villagers and then adding, well, Doom, Death & Destruction. In our defense: the theme of Ludum Dare 33, which this was built for, was "You Are The Monster". So we basically had to do something like this.

#### The Side Effects Of Life In Space
![TSEOL Image](/img/tseoldemoimage.PNG#center)  
I have been working with a small team on a very long-term project with the catchy title "The Side Effects of Life in Space". Been on hold for a while, but we might continue this someday. :)

## Front-End Development
I worked on several web and mobile projects, mostly using Angular. Things I built include interactive quiz applications for use in trainings, components for cross-platform applications (iOS,Android,Web) using Nativescript and some prototypes for Twitch extension development.

## Escape Rooms

I helped design and build an Escape Room in DÃ¼sseldorf under the name "Portalstation" from 2018-2020. I worked on a bit of microcontroller programming there as well while designing and building interactive puzzles using various sensor inputs.
