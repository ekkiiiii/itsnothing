Another update! Since we could not secure funding for further projects with Gentleforge I am currently looking for work again. Great opportunity to update the portfolio/website here.

I already updated the "Stuff I built" page with some new details and am going to write an update on what I am doing on the side at the moment next.

In the last few months I started playing around with Yahaha, a software platform for creating real-time 3D content. It feels very much like a light version of Unity. It is still in an early stage of development so I am trying to focus on providing basic documentation so people can figure out how to build cool stuff.
One thing I did was generating documentation for the yahaha lua scripting backend. It is currently available here on my old companies page, but since I don't have access to that anymore I'll upload new versions here:
