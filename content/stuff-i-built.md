I like to build things! This page shows some of the things I helped to build. For a CV-like overview visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janerikbaehr/)-page.
  
What I like most is the practical aspect of building (virtual) things: writing code, creating prototypes, taking an idea into the real world and then seeing what works and - behold - what does not work as intended.
But since I always worked in small teams that require a large amount of self-organization I am used to spending just as much as time with the theoretical side of it: working on game design and technical architectures, figuring out how to make something that is fun to interact with.

## Front-End Development
I worked on several web and mobile projects, mostly using Angular. Things I built include interactive quiz applications for use in trainings, components for cross-platform applications (iOS,Android,Web) using Nativescript and some prototypes for Twitch extension development.

## Games

I have been working with a small team on a very long-term project with the catchy title "The Side Effects of Life in Space". Been on hold for a while, but we might continue this someday. :)

## Escape Rooms

I helped design and build an Escape Room in DÃ¼sseldorf under the name "Portalstation" from 2018-2020. I worked on a bit of microcontroller programming there as well while designing and building interactive puzzles using various sensor inputs.
