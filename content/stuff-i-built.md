I like to build things, this page is a collection of some of the things I helped to build.
  
I really like the practical aspect of building (virtual) things: writing code, creating prototypes, my fascination there is about testing and failing with new ideas.
But since I always worked in small teams that require a large amount of self-organization I am used to spending just as much as time with the theoretical side of it: working on game design and technical architectures, figuring out how to make something that is fun to interact with.
  
## Games

### Fairyfail

Since January 2021 I have been working at [Gentleforge](https://gentleforge.com/) where I worked on programming and game design for [Fairyfail](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1194670/Fairyfail) until we shipped the game in July and for the 'Bewitched' Update in October.

### The Side Effects Of Life In Space

I have been working with a small team on a very long-term project with the catchy title "The Side Effects of Life in Space". //TODO add some preview content or link to it

## Front-End Development

I worked on several web and mobile projects, mostly using Angular. //TODO add some examples here :)

## Escape Rooms

I helped design and build an Escape Room in DÃ¼sseldorf under the name "Portalstation" from 2018-2020. I worked on a bit of Microcontroller Programming there as well while designing and building interactive puzzles using various sensor inputs.
