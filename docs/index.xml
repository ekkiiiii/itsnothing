      <description>Oh, hey, the first update in checks notes years. I am currently working on a project with some motion controls, if it works out I will write a post about it.
Here is a sneak peak using the Nuitrack SDK to get some live skeleton data in Unity:
 Your browser does not support video.  Since the last update I started working at https://www.gentleforge.com/ and updated the page info accordingly.</description>

      <title>Revisiting old unity projects - Part 2</title>

      <description>Last time I revisited Potion Shift from April 2016 to make a 64-bit-version for Android. That went pretty well, so this time I&amp;rsquo;ll go back to the first jam game I did. It is called Affectionate Armament, made for Ludum Dare 32 with the theme &amp;ldquo;An Unconventional Weapon&amp;rdquo;. The idea we went with was to have a weapon with feelings. It&amp;rsquo;s a two player action game with one weapon, and once a player grabs it they can start shooting the other player.</description>

      <description>I have a bunch of old Unity projects lying around, mostly from gamejams. Instant learning, just looking at the menu for our 2016 Ludum Dare Game &amp;ldquo;Potion Shift&amp;rdquo;: Don&amp;rsquo;t be too ambitious with announcing features/content, especially don&amp;rsquo;t put them in your main menu:
Coming, Coming Soon&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t think so :P
From now on I&amp;rsquo;ll just put things in blogposts that I can silently delete later to undo any unfulfilled announcements ;)</description>

      <title>Creating websites with hugo</title>

      <description>For the longest time, I used to build websites with Wordpress. It&amp;rsquo;s easy, performance was never that much of an issue for me and it enabled me to give non-technical users the opportunity to create content. But if you ever had a wordpress blog with a handful of plugins running unattended for a while you know that, well you can&amp;rsquo;t leave it unattended actually. Even though wordpress has an automatic updating mechanism by now, keeping up interoperability of plugins/theme and the base wordpress install requires attention from time to time.</description>

      <description>How is this site made? The page is built with Hugo, I have already written about it here.
The theme is called terminal and it is made by panr.
You can retrace all the customizations I made and will make on the blog&amp;rsquo;s GitHub repository.
What about those neat graphics? The images are virtuosly made with Microsoft Paint, with the help of a graphics tablet or directly on a touchscreen, so you&amp;rsquo;ll only find hand-made, artisanal blog graphics here.</description>

      <description>I like to build things, this page is a collection of some of the things I helped to build.
I really like the practical aspect of building (virtual) things: writing code, creating prototypes, my fascination there is about testing and failing with new ideas. But since I always worked in small teams that require a large amount of self-organization I am used to spending just as much as time with the theoretical side of it: working on game design and technical architectures, figuring out how to make something that is fun to interact with.</description>
