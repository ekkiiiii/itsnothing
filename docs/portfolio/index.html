<p>What I like most is the practical aspect of building (virtual) things: writing code, creating prototypes, taking an idea into the real world and then seeing what works and - behold - what does not work as intended.
But since I always worked in small teams that require a large amount of self-organization I am used to spending just as much as time with the theoretical side of it: working on game design and technical architectures and figuring out how to make something that is fun to interact with.</p>
<h2 id="mixed-reality-development">Mixed Reality Development<a href="#mixed-reality-development" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>In 2023 and 2024 I was employed to work on a mixed reality platform and several projects based on that. I still worked in the same Unity/C# environment I used for game development, only with more serious use cases. There were many overlapping design issues coming from game development, but the technical requirements were more narrow which resulted in a different development focus than the previous game projects I worked on.</p>

<p>From January 2021 to July 2022 I was working at <a href="https://gentleforge.com/">Gentleforge</a> where I did programming and game design for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1194670/Fairyfail">Fairyfail</a> until we shipped the game in July 2021 and for the &lsquo;Bewitched&rsquo; Update in October 2021.</p>

<p>A personal side project I built together with <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/artvefroh">@VeFroh</a>. We created the design based on a cancelled project that we worked on together at Gentleforge before. Vero contributed the art and I did the coding. We have stopped working after this first prototype and changed the game concept a lot, but stuck with the Shiba theme and overall mood. <a href="http://www.itsnothing.de/post/shiba-rush-post-mortem/">I have written a small post mortem about that prototype here</a>. An update about the new project will follow in a few weeks.</p>

<p>A collectible book game built for Ludum Dare in three days. We set out with a mission to keep the scope small&hellip; To end up with something way too complicated yet again - but it was really fun and definetely turned out interesting. No one from our team did have time to take part in the judging phase for this one :(.<br>

<p>This was done for Manasoup Game Jam, a gamejam from a german speaking community for game developers. It was only a two day gamejam and we had a pretty big team to manage. I like how small we kept the scope, and even added the repeat functionality a few weeeks after the jam.</p>

<p>We had some fun here creating a small simulation of villagers and then adding, well, Doom, Death &amp; Destruction. In our defense: the theme of Ludum Dare 33, which this was built for, was &ldquo;You Are The Monster&rdquo;. So we basically had to do something like this.<br>

I have been working with a small team on a very long-term project with the catchy title &ldquo;The Side Effects of Life in Space&rdquo;. Been on hold for a while, but we might continue this someday. :)</p>

<p>I worked on several web and mobile projects, mostly using Angular. Things I built include interactive quiz applications for use in trainings, components for cross-platform applications (iOS,Android,Web) using Nativescript and some prototypes for Twitch extension development.</p>
<h2 id="escape-rooms">Escape Rooms<a href="#escape-rooms" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I helped design and build an Escape Room in Düsseldorf under the name &ldquo;Portalstation&rdquo; from 2018-2020. I worked on a bit of microcontroller programming there as well while designing and building interactive puzzles using various sensor inputs.</p>
