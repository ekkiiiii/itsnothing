      <description>I have a bunch of old Unity projects lying around, mostly from gamejams. Instant learning, just looking at the menu for our 2016 Ludum Dare Game &amp;ldquo;Potion Shift&amp;rdquo;: Don&amp;rsquo;t be too ambitious with announcing features/content, especially don&amp;rsquo;t put them in your main menu:
Coming, Coming Soon&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t think so :P
From now on I&amp;rsquo;ll just put things in blogposts that I can silently delete later to undo any unfulfilled announcements ;)</description>

      <description>For the longest time, I used to build websites with Wordpress. It&amp;rsquo;s easy, performance was never that much of an issue for me and it enabled me to give non-technical users the opportunity to create content. But if you ever had a wordpress blog with a handful of plugins running unattended for a while you know that, well you can&amp;rsquo;t leave it unattended actually. Even though wordpress has an automatic updating mechanism by now, keeping up interoperability of plugins/theme and the base wordpress install requires attention from time to time.</description>
