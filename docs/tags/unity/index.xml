      <description>Last time I revisited Potion Shift from April 2016 to make a 64-bit-version for Android. That went pretty well, so this time I&amp;rsquo;ll go back to the first jam game I did. It is called Affectionate Armament, made for Ludum Dare 32 with the theme &amp;ldquo;An Unconventional Weapon&amp;rdquo;. The idea we went with was to have a weapon with feelings. It&amp;rsquo;s a two player action game with one weapon, and once a player grabs it they can start shooting the other player.</description>

      <description>I have a bunch of old Unity projects lying around, mostly from gamejams. Instant learning, just looking at the menu for our 2016 Ludum Dare Game &amp;ldquo;Potion Shift&amp;rdquo;: Don&amp;rsquo;t be too ambitious with announcing features/content, especially don&amp;rsquo;t put them in your main menu:
Coming, Coming Soon&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t think so :P
From now on I&amp;rsquo;ll just put things in blogposts that I can silently delete later to undo any unfulfilled announcements ;)</description>
